# pm2-labor
This repository contains all  Labor work for this second semester at the HAW University.
I have successfuly completed this Labor Session.I liked the time pace we had for this 
entire labor.
For this session we had to use the Java Programming language and I had fun learning Java.
But every good thing have an End. 
The learn curve was not to high for me.
Here is the list of thing I liked when using Java:
* The API : I didn't feel the need to surf the web to understand what a Method was about.
* The Library : I liked the fact that Library contains a rich set of modules so you don't 
a third party component to get the job done.
